[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage

Include this module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "alb_ingress" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb-ingress.git?ref=tags/0.2.0"
  namespace          = "eg"
  name               = "app"
  stage              = "dev"

  vpc_id              = "xxxxxxxx"
  listener_arns       = ["xxxxxx", "yyyyyyy"]
  listener_arns_count = "2"
  health_check_path   = "/healthz"
  paths               = ["/*"]
}
```






## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                Help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  help/short                          This help short screen
  lint                                Lint terraform code

| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `namespace`, `name`, `stage` and `attributes` | string | `-` | no |
| deregistration_delay | The amount of time to wait in seconds while deregistering target | string | `15` | no |

| listener_arns | A list of ALB listener ARNs to attach ALB listener rules to | list | `<list>` | no |
| listener_arns_count | The number of ARNs in `listener_arns`. This is necessary to work around a limitation in Terraform where counts cannot be computed | string | `0` | no |

| port | The port for generated ALB target group (if target_group_arn not set) | string | `80` | no |
| priority | The priority for the rules, between 1 and 50000 (1 being highest priority). Must be different from `priority_with_authentication` since a listener can't have multiple rules with the same priority | string | `100` | no |
| priority_with_authentication | The priority for the rules with authentication, between 1 and 50000 (1 being highest priority). Must be different from `priority` since a listener can't have multiple rules with the same priority | string | `300` | no |

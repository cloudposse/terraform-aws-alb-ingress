This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Usage

Include this module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "alb_ingress" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb-ingress.git?ref=tags/0.2.0"
  namespace          = "eg"
  name               = "app"
  stage              = "dev"

  vpc_id              = "xxxxxxxx"
  listener_arns       = ["xxxxxx", "yyyyyyy"]
  listener_arns_count = "2"
  health_check_path   = "/healthz"
  paths               = ["/*"]
}
```






## Makefile Targets
